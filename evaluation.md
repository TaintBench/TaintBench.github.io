# RQ2 How effective are taint analysis tools on TaintBench compared to DroidBench?

## List of Evaluated Tools

| Tool          | Version           | Source  |
| ------------- |-------------|-----|
| Amandroid	 | November 2017 (3.1.2) 	| [Link](https://bintray.com/arguslab/maven/argus-saf/3.1.2)|         
| Amandroid* | December 2018 (3.2.0) 	| [Link](https://bintray.com/arguslab/maven/argus-saf/3.2.0)|          
| FlowDroid	 | April 2017 (Nightly)  	| [Link](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/soot-infoflow-android/wiki)| 
| FlowDroid* | January 2019 (2.7.1)  	| [Link](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/releases/tag/v2.7.1)| 

[Download All Tools](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/releases/tag/TaintAnalysisTools)

## Experiment 1 (Default)
**Configuration**: 
All tools are executed in their default configuration. Sources and sinks configured for the tools can be found below:
- [Amandroid & Amandroid*](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/blob/master/AD_SourcesAndSinks.txt)
- [FlowDroid & FlowDroid*](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/blob/master/FD_SourcesAndSinks.txt)

## Experiment 2 (Suite-level)
**Configuration**: 
All tools are configured with sources and sinks defined in benchmark suite. Sources and sinks of the benchmark suites configured for the tools can be found below:
- [DroidBench](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/blob/master/DB_SourcesAndSinks.txt)
- [TaintBench](https://github.com/TaintBench/TaintBench/blob/master/TB_SourcesAndSinks.txt)  

# RQ3 What insights can we gain by evaluating analysis tools on TaintBench?

## Experiment 3 (App-level)
**Configuration**: 
For each benchmark app, a list of sources and sinks defined in this app is used to configure all tools. Each tool analyzes each benchmark app with the associated list of sources and sinks. 

## Experiment 4 (Case-level)
**Configuration**: 
For each benchmark case (taint flow), only the source and sink defined in this case is used to configure all tools. 

Assume a benchmark app contains `N` benchmark cases, each tool analyzes the benchmark app `N` times. Each time the tools are configured with the associated source and sink for the respective benchmark case. 

## Experiment 5 (Minified App)
For each benchmark case, a minified Apk is generated by the MinApkGenerator. 

## Experiment 6 (Delta App)
For each benchmark case, a delta Apk is generated by the DeltaApkGenerator.
